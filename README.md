# RobotSlacker Project

This is a simple introduction about robotslacker project.

I plan to use this project to setup a  test environment.

This environment is built based on Docker, K8S and other softwares.

This test environment should include:

1. A Gitlab service for software code management
2. An LDAP service for user authentication
3. A testing service based on RF, Selenium, SikuliX
4. A new CompareLibrary, used in RF, supports regular expression matching
5. A farm test environment to complete regression testing

This is just the beginning, let me slowly perfect him.
